1. Explore Hurricanes and Atmospheric Rivers using the data generated by the NOAA stationary buoys along with data and information from NOAA, the Hurricaneexposure package and other sources.

- prepare maps, variograms and semi-variograms as part of your exploration document your data exploration.
- Start out by simply validating the Hurricane Exposure data with the data reported by buoys.
    - Pick a hurricane. Visualize it. Find NOAA buoys near the hurricane path.
    - Use ggplot2 to compare the buoy data with the data from the hurricaneexposure package.
2. When having finished with the hurricane data, do a similar analysis with an Atmospheric River.

3. Come to class ready to discuss what we have done.
